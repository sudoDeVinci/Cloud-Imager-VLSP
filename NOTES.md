- Need to change all string datetimes to datetime objects. - Tedious but necessary
- Add accuracy to the website as a metric alongside AUC.
- Move class definitions such as Colour_Tag and ChanelBoundary to their own files.
- Switch to serializing chanelbound data as json/toml.
- use @property tags on Entities to obfuscate provate properties. The speed loss is negligible.
- COnversion to and from datetimes in database.
