The sensors work!

In the end, my issue was weirdly simple:
Esp32 boards have built-in internal resistors which can be configured as either Pull-up or Pull-down. The libraries for these when using the serial bus would normally configure them as needed automatically. However, this is not the case. I tried configuring this in software and it just wouldn't work. In the end, I just added two 3.3kOhm resistors accross the serial lines as pullups, and the sensors worked just fine with the most popular libraries.

It also sent the information fine across wifi to the server, and was even able to connect to the server simultaneously with another board. The java-based server has been mostly completed, though I will be extending its functionality later with a Database Manager and suite of analysis tools/scripts in Python to integrate into it rather than running them independently. For now, the main focus is making it stable, able to run continuously unsupervised for long periods. This means alot of error handling, graceful failing and accounting for the many possibilities in data transmission.

As of now, the next steps will be towards better analysis, more data collection
