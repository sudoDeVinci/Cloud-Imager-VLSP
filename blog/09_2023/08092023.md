In pursuit of the database integration route, I've started working on the database manager portion of it. SO far I've only gotten the schema done as of yet.

The other thing I've done is improving not only the performance of the analysis scripts for the colour channel data, but also the formatting and actual data reported. I've read more of the relevant literature and gotten a better idea of what I need to prove and continuously develop my process.
