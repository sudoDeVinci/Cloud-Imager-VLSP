In pursuit of the database integration route, I've started working on the database manager portion of it. SO far I've only gotten the schema done as of yet.

The other thing I've done is improving not only the performance of the analysis scripts for the colour channel data, but also the formatting and actual data reported. I've read more of the relevant literature and gotten a better idea of what I need to prove and continuously develop my process.

Recently, mymain progress has been with revising and learning statistics at the level needed to meaningfully analyze the results. THe second part of course is collecting the data, but first I need to determine what kinda of data would be most advantageous considering my lack of time to spare.
