While I've been trying to create a cohesive system using the S3, I've had to face my lack of a fundamental understanding of the Arduino language, so the past week, I have stagnated somewhat. I did manage to save images to the SD card on the device though, which is a step in the right direction.

I'm also already starting to realize I may have made a mistake in my choice of hardware. The new boards are pretty much better in every way, but what good is that if I don't know how to use those new cool, shiny features? Especially within a reasonable time frame. For now then, I'll continue splitting my attention in two directions. I'll be learning C++ and going through the ESP32-S3 docs to understand them better, and hopefully find an easier way of getting the results I want.
I'll be mainly using the docs from FreeNove's github, [here](https://github.com/Freenove/Freenove_ESP32_S3_WROOM_Board) and since specific hardware programming guides for ESP devices in Arduino are in short supply, I'll go through learning regular C++ for now then attempt to translate that to hardware programming with Arduino.
