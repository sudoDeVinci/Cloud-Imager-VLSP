The past two weeks or so has been almost exclsuively updating the existing codebase for better practices. While I had personal reasons, this was also because iterating through new versions/changes to the microcontroller code was slow. To check changes in the the image distributions took minutes per run.
When I originally started this codebase, I lacked the microcontroller knowledge, as well as the programming, maths and documentation skills for something this large. Therefore, all graphing portions, utility functions, and documentation got an overhaul. 

To give an idea of the of progress made; in the beginning:
Using [pca_graphs](pca_graphs.py) on 60 400x300 resolution images took 4 minutes on my Ryzen 2700x system with 16GB of DDR4 3200 to just construct a single pandas dataframe. It consumed a peak of just over the full 16GB of RAM.
Now, the entirety of the program completes in about the same time +-30seconds on an i5-3210M, using a peak of ~4GB.
Similarly, [colour_graphs](colour_graphs.py) took ~2 minutes on the Ryzen system. This now takes 12 seconds on the i5-3210M system.

Some key performance points: 

- Images are resized before being processed. This is common practice for image classifier operations:

```python

    blockedImage = cv2.imread(Blocked)
    blockedImage = cv2.resize(blockedImage,(150, 150))
    blockedImageHSV = cv2.cvtColor(blockedImage,cv2.COLOR_BGR2HSV)
    
    referenceImage = cv2.imread(Reference)
    referenceImage = cv2.resize(referenceImage,(150, 150))
    referenceImageHSV = cv2.cvtColor(referenceImage,cv2.COLOR_BGR2HSV)

```

- Very aggressive garbage collection in sections where many intermediate steps are needed, such as during colour masking images:
```python
    del u_b_red1HSV 
    del l_b_red1HSV 
    del u_b_red2HSV 
    del l_b_red2HSV 
    del maskOneRedHSV 
    del maskTwoRedHSV 
    del redMaskHSV 
    del u_b_blackHSV 
    del l_b_blackHSV 
    del blackMaskHSV
    del blockedImageHSV 
    del referenceImage
    del referenceImageHSV
    collect()
```

- Just-in-time compilation for vector/matrix arithmetic through the numba library:
```python

    cbgrch = cv2.split(cloudImageBGR)
    sbgrch = cv2.split(skyImageBGR)
    chsvch = cv2.split(cloudImageHSV)
    shsvch = cv2.split(skyImageHSV)

    @jit(nopython=True, cache=True)
    def readoutbgr(bgr, nparray):
        b, g, r = bgr
        for x,y,z in zip(b,g,r):
            for i,o,u in zip(x,y,z):
                if i!= 0 or o!=0 or u!=0:
                    if i and o and u:
                        nparray[0][i] += 1
                        nparray[1][o] += 1
                        nparray[2][u] += 1
        return nparray
    
    @jit(nopython=True, cache=True)
    def readouthsv(hsv, nparray):
        h, s, v = hsv
        for x,y,z in zip(h,s,v):
            for i,o,u in zip(x,y,z):
                if u!=0:
                    nparray[0][i] += 1
                    nparray[1][o] += 1
                    nparray[2][u] += 1
        return nparray
        
```

The next step will be to get the ESP32 working with the new sensors instead of pycom pysense board to test that they work.
After this, I'll be adapting the code to the new ESP32 S3 boards.
